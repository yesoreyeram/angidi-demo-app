# ADR-001: Use Microservices Architecture

**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: Accepted

## Context

We need to design the architecture for a large-scale e-commerce platform that will serve millions of users with high availability and scalability requirements. The platform needs to handle various business domains including user management, product catalog, orders, payments, inventory, and more.

### Background
- Expected scale: 100M users, 10M products, 100K requests/second
- Availability target: 99.99% uptime
- Must support independent scaling of different components
- Different components have different consistency requirements
- Educational project focused on learning system design patterns

### Assumptions
- Team will grow to support multiple services
- Services will evolve at different rates
- Different services may use different technology stacks
- Need to support rapid iteration and deployment

## Decision

We will implement a **microservices architecture** with each business domain as a separate service.

## Rationale

### Why Microservices?

1. **Independent Scalability**: Each service can be scaled independently based on its load (e.g., search service may need more instances than payment service)

2. **Technology Flexibility**: Services can use the most appropriate technology for their needs (e.g., MongoDB for product catalog, PostgreSQL for orders)

3. **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one service doesn't bring down the entire system

4. **Team Autonomy**: Different teams can own different services and deploy independently

5. **Learning Objective**: This is an educational project - microservices expose students to distributed systems concepts

### Options Considered

#### Option 1: Monolithic Architecture
**Pros**:
- Simpler to develop initially
- Easier to debug and test
- No network overhead between components
- Simpler deployment

**Cons**:
- Everything must scale together (inefficient)
- Single point of failure
- Difficult to adopt new technologies
- Large codebase becomes hard to maintain
- Doesn't teach distributed systems concepts

**Trade-offs**: Simpler short-term but doesn't meet long-term scalability and learning goals

#### Option 2: Modular Monolith
**Pros**:
- Well-defined module boundaries
- Can evolve to microservices later
- Simpler than full microservices
- Maintains some organizational benefits

**Cons**:
- Still shares same scaling limitations
- Modules can become coupled over time
- Doesn't address independent deployment
- Limits learning of distributed patterns

**Trade-offs**: Middle ground but doesn't achieve core objectives

#### Option 3: Microservices Architecture (Chosen)
**Pros**:
- Independent scalability per service
- Fault isolation
- Technology flexibility
- Independent deployment
- Team autonomy
- Teaches distributed systems patterns

**Cons**:
- Increased complexity
- Network latency between services
- Distributed debugging challenges
- Need service mesh/API gateway
- Data consistency challenges
- Higher operational overhead

**Trade-offs**: Accept complexity and operational overhead for scalability, resilience, and learning value

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- Each service can be scaled based on its specific load patterns
- Failures are isolated (circuit breakers prevent cascading)
- Teams can deploy services independently
- Students learn real-world distributed systems patterns
- Can optimize each service for its specific use case

### Negative Consequences
- Increased operational complexity (mitigate with Kubernetes, service mesh)
- Need for distributed tracing (address in Phase 8)
- Data consistency challenges (use Saga pattern for distributed transactions)
- Higher initial development effort (worthwhile for learning objectives)
- Need robust monitoring and observability (implement in Phase 7-8)

### Neutral Consequences
- Team must learn distributed systems concepts
- Need investment in infrastructure tooling
- Documentation becomes more critical

## Implementation

### Services Identified

1. **User Service**: Authentication, profiles, roles
2. **Product Catalog Service**: Product CRUD, categories
3. **Search Service**: Elasticsearch-based search
4. **Shopping Cart Service**: Cart management
5. **Order Service**: Order lifecycle management
6. **Inventory Service**: Stock management
7. **Payment Service**: Payment processing
8. **Notification Service**: Email, SMS, push notifications
9. **Recommendation Service**: Personalized recommendations
10. **Review Service**: Product reviews and ratings
11. **Admin Service**: Administrative functions

### Action Items
- [x] Document service boundaries
- [x] Define inter-service communication patterns
- [ ] Implement API Gateway (Phase 1-2)
- [ ] Set up service mesh (Phase 11)
- [ ] Implement distributed tracing (Phase 8)

### Timeline
- Phase 1: Start with monolith
- Phase 2: Extract first microservice
- Phase 3-6: Gradually decompose remaining services
- Phase 7-8: Add observability
- Phase 11: Deploy to Kubernetes

### Validation
Success criteria:
- Each service can be deployed independently
- Services can scale independently
- System maintains operation when individual services fail
- p95 latency remains <200ms
- System achieves 99.99% uptime

## Related Decisions
- ADR-002: Event-Driven Communication (Kafka)
- ADR-003: Database per Service
- ADR-004: API Gateway Pattern

## Notes
- Start with a monolith in Phase 1 to establish patterns
- Gradually decompose into microservices (Phase 2+)
- Focus on learning - complexity is part of the lesson
- Each phase introduces 1-2 new concepts/tools
