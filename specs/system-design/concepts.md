# System Design Concepts

This document outlines all the advanced system design concepts that will be covered throughout the Angidi project.

## Core Concepts Checklist

### 1. Scalability
- [ ] **Horizontal Scaling** - Adding more servers to distribute load
- [ ] **Vertical Scaling** - Increasing resources of existing servers
- [ ] **Database Sharding** - Partitioning data across multiple databases
- [ ] **Database Replication** - Creating copies for read scaling
- [ ] **Load Balancing** - Distributing requests across servers
- [ ] **Auto-scaling** - Automatically adjusting resources based on demand

### 2. Architecture Patterns
- [ ] **Microservices Architecture** - Decomposing application into small services
- [ ] **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** - Organizing functionality as services
- [ ] **Event-Driven Architecture** - Communication through events

- [ ] **API Gateway Pattern** - Single entry point for all client requests
- [ ] **Saga Pattern** - Managing distributed transactions

### 3. Data Management
- [ ] **CAP Theorem** - Understanding Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance trade-offs
- [ ] **Strong Consistency** - Immediate consistency across all nodes
- [ ] **Eventual Consistency** - Delayed consistency acceptable for some operations
- [ ] **Database Partitioning** - Distributing data for performance
- [ ] **Data Replication Strategies** - Synchronous vs asynchronous replication

### 4. Messaging & Communication
- [ ] **Message Queues** - Asynchronous communication between services
- [ ] **Event Streaming** - Real-time event processing
- [ ] **Publish-Subscribe Pattern** - One-to-many message distribution
- [ ] **Request-Response Pattern** - Synchronous communication
- [ ] **Message Brokers** - Kafka, RabbitMQ, Google Pub/Sub

### 5. Reliability & Fault Tolerance
- [ ] **Circuit Breaker Pattern** - Preventing cascading failures
- [ ] **Retry Mechanisms** - Handling transient failures
- [ ] **Bulkhead Pattern** - Isolating resources to prevent total failure
- [ ] **Rate Limiting** - Protecting services from overload
- [ ] **Graceful Degradation** - Maintaining partial functionality during failures
- [ ] **Health Checks** - Monitoring service health

### 6. Performance Optimization
- [ ] **Caching Layers** - CDN, application cache, database cache
- [ ] **Database Indexing** - Optimizing query performance
- [ ] **Query Optimization** - Efficient database queries
- [ ] **Connection Pooling** - Reusing database connections
- [ ] **Lazy Loading** - Loading data only when needed
- [ ] **Pagination** - Efficiently handling large datasets

### 7. Security
- [ ] **Authentication** - Verifying user identity
- [ ] **Authorization** - Controlling access to resources
- [ ] **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect** - Delegated authorization
- [ ] **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** - Stateless authentication
- [ ] **API Security** - Securing API endpoints
- [ ] **PCI-DSS Compliance** - Payment card data security
- [ ] **Encryption** - Data encryption at rest and in transit
- [ ] **Secret Management** - Securely storing credentials

### 8. Observability
- [ ] **Logging** - Centralized logging with structured logs
- [ ] **Metrics** - Collecting and analyzing system metrics
- [ ] **Distributed Tracing** - Tracking requests across services
- [ ] **Alerting** - Automated alerts for issues
- [ ] **Dashboards** - Visualizing system health
- [ ] **APM (Application Performance Monitoring)** - End-to-end performance tracking

### 9. Testing Strategies
- [ ] **Unit Testing** - Testing individual components
- [ ] **Integration Testing** - Testing service interactions
- [ ] **End-to-End Testing** - Testing complete user flows
- [ ] **Load Testing** - Testing system under high load
- [ ] **Stress Testing** - Testing system beyond normal capacity
- [ ] **Chaos Engineering** - Testing resilience through failures
- [ ] **Contract Testing** - Testing service contracts

### 10. Deployment & Operations
- [ ] **Containerization** - Using Docker for packaging
- [ ] **Container Orchestration** - Kubernetes for managing containers
- [ ] **CI/CD Pipelines** - Automated build, test, and deployment
- [ ] **Blue-Green Deployment** - Zero-downtime deployments
- [ ] **Canary Deployment** - Gradual rollout to subset of users
- [ ] **Infrastructure as Code** - Managing infrastructure through code
- [ ] **Configuration Management** - Managing application configuration

### 11. Distributed Systems
- [ ] **Distributed Locks** - Coordinating access to shared resources
- [ ] **Consensus Algorithms** - Achieving agreement in distributed systems
- [ ] **Time Synchronization** - Managing time across distributed nodes
- [ ] **Idempotency** - Ensuring operations can be safely retried
- [ ] **Two-Phase Commit** - Coordinating distributed transactions
- [ ] **Distributed Caching** - Caching across multiple nodes

### 12. Data Storage
- [ ] **Relational Databases** - SQL databases for structured data
- [ ] **NoSQL Databases** - Document, key-value, column-family stores
- [ ] **Search Engines** - Elasticsearch, Solr for full-text search
- [ ] **Object Storage** - S3, GCS for large files
- [ ] **Time-Series Databases** - Specialized for time-series data
- [ ] **Graph Databases** - For highly connected data
