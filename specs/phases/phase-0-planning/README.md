# Phase 0: Planning & Repository Setup

**Duration**: 1 week
**Status**: In Progress

## Overview

Phase 0 establishes the foundation for the entire Angidi project. This phase focuses on comprehensive planning, documentation, and setting up the project structure without any actual implementation code.

## Goals

### Primary Goals
1. Create comprehensive specification kit with all planning documents
2. Define system design concepts and learning roadmap
3. Document all functional and non-functional requirements
4. Design high-level architecture and component interactions
5. Set up repository structure and conventions
6. Create phase-based learning templates
7. Establish development guidelines and standards

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the importance of thorough planning in large-scale systems
- Learn to document requirements comprehensively
- Practice creating technical specifications
- Understand system design documentation patterns
- Learn to structure projects for long-term maintainability

## System Design Concepts

This phase introduces foundational concepts without implementation:

### 1. Requirements Engineering
- **Functional Requirements**: What the system should do
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: How the system should perform
- **Acceptance Criteria**: How to validate requirements

### 2. System Architecture Design
- **High-Level Architecture**: Overall system structure
- **Component Design**: Breaking down into services
- **Data Architecture**: Database and storage strategy
- **Communication Patterns**: How components interact

### 3. Documentation Patterns
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Documenting design decisions
- **Specification Documents**: Detailed technical specs
- **Runbooks**: Operational procedures
- **API Documentation**: Contract specifications

### 4. Project Planning
- **Phase-Based Development**: Incremental delivery
- **Technology Roadmap**: Tool introduction strategy
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying potential issues
- **Capacity Planning**: Resource estimation

## Tools Introduced

### Development Tools
- **Git**: Version control
- **GitHub**: Code hosting and collaboration
- **Markdown**: Documentation format
- **Shell Scripts**: Automation and tooling

### Documentation Tools
- **Markdown**: For all documentation
- **Diagrams**: Mermaid or PlantUML for architecture diagrams
- **GitHub Wiki** (optional): Extended documentation

## Design Decisions

### 1. Specification Kit Structure

**Decision**: Use `.spec/` directory for all specification documents

**Rationale**:
- Keeps specifications separate from implementation
- Easy to navigate and maintain
- Version controlled alongside code
- Follows industry patterns (similar to GitHub spec kit)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Wiki-only documentation: Less portable, harder to version
- Mixed documentation: Harder to maintain consistency

### 2. Phase-Based Approach

**Decision**: Organize project into 13 distinct phases

**Rationale**:
- Incremental learning of concepts
- Manageable chunks of work
- Each phase has clear objectives
- Easy to track progress
- Introduces only 1-2 tools per phase (avoids overwhelm)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Big-bang approach: Too complex, hard to learn
- Feature-based: Doesn't align with learning objectives

### 3. Documentation-First Approach

**Decision**: Complete documentation before any implementation

**Rationale**:
- Clear requirements prevent scope creep
- Design decisions are documented early
- Easier to validate against requirements
- Serves as learning material
- Facilitates discussions and reviews

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Code-first: Can lead to unclear requirements
- Parallel: Documentation often gets neglected

### 4. Shell Scripts for Automation

**Decision**: Use shell scripts for spec kit management

**Rationale**:
- Lightweight and portable
- No additional dependencies
- Works in Linux environment (as specified)
- Easy to understand and modify
- Fast execution

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Python scripts: Additional dependency
- Make: Less flexible for complex logic
- Task runners: Overkill for this purpose

## Testing Strategy

### Documentation Testing
Since this phase has no implementation, testing focuses on documentation quality:

1. **Completeness Check**
   - All sections are filled out
   - No TODO markers remain
   - Cross-references are valid

2. **Consistency Check**
   - Terminology is consistent across documents
   - Numbers and metrics align
   - References are accurate

3. **Validation Scripts**
   - Run `./spec/scripts/validate.sh` to check structure
   - Verify all markdown files render correctly
   - Check for broken links

4. **Review Checklist**
   - Technical accuracy reviewed
   - Clarity and readability verified
   - Examples are appropriate
   - Diagrams are clear

## Notes

This phase is purely planning and documentation. No code implementation is required or expected. The goal is to think through the entire system comprehensively before writing a single line of code.

Take time to understand each system design concept and how they interconnect. The quality of planning in this phase will directly impact the success of all subsequent phases.
