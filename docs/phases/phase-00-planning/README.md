## Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Microservices Architecture
**Rationale**: 
- Enables independent scaling of services
- Allows technology flexibility per service
- Facilitates team autonomy
- Supports gradual modernization

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Pros: Scalability, flexibility, resilience
- ❌ Cons: Complexity, distributed transactions, operational overhead

**Alternatives Considered**: Monolith, modular monolith

---

### Decision 2: Go for Backend
**Rationale**:
- Excellent performance and concurrency
- Strong standard library
- Fast compilation
- Growing ecosystem for cloud-native apps

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Pros: Performance, simplicity, built-in concurrency
- ❌ Cons: Less mature ecosystem than Java/Python, verbose error handling

**Alternatives Considered**: Java, Node.js, Python

---

### Decision 3: Next.js for Frontend
**Rationale**:
- Server-side rendering for SEO and performance
- Built-in API routes
- Excellent developer experience
- Large community and ecosystem

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Pros: SEO, performance, DX, full-stack capability
- ❌ Cons: Framework lock-in, learning curve

**Alternatives Considered**: Gatsby, Remix, Nuxt.js

---

### Decision 4: PostgreSQL as Primary Database
**Rationale**:
- Strong ACID guarantees for transactions
- Mature and battle-tested
- Rich feature set (JSONB, full-text search, extensions)
- Excellent performance

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Pros: Reliability, features, performance
- ❌ Cons: Vertical scaling limits, complex sharding

**Alternatives Considered**: MySQL, CockroachDB

---

### Decision 5: Phased Approach (16 Phases)
**Rationale**:
- Gradual learning curve
- Early feedback and validation
- Risk mitigation
- Clear milestones and deliverables

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Pros: Manageable complexity, early value, flexibility
- ❌ Cons: Longer overall timeline, potential rework

**Alternatives Considered**: Big-bang approach, fewer larger phases
