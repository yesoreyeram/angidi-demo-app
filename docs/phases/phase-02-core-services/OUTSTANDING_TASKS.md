### Frontend ⚠️ (0% Complete)
- Registration page: 0/1 ❌
- Login page: 0/1 ❌
- Product catalog: 0/1 ❌
- Authentication state: 0/1 ❌
- Error handling: 0/1 ❌
- Loading states: 0/1 ❌
- E2E tests: 0/1 ❌

**Overall Phase 2 Completion: ~59%**

## Risks & Blockers

### Current Blockers
- None - backend API is ready and tested

### Potential Risks
- **Time**: Frontend implementation is substantial work
- **Testing**: E2E testing requires both backend and frontend running
- **CORS**: May need to adjust CORS settings for development
- **Token Storage**: Need to decide on localStorage vs HTTP-only cookies

### Mitigation
- Backend API is stable and well-tested
- Clear implementation plan with priorities
- All API endpoints documented with examples
- Integration tests verify backend functionality

---

## Success Criteria

Phase 2 will be considered **100% complete** when:

1. ✅ Backend: All services implemented and tested
2. ⚠️ Frontend: All pages functional and connected to backend
3. ⚠️ Authentication: Users can register, login, and manage profile
4. ⚠️ Products: Users can browse products, admins can manage
5. ⚠️ Testing: Frontend tests passing
6. ⚠️ Documentation: Frontend usage documented
7. ⚠️ E2E: Complete user flows work end-to-end

**Current Status: 1/7 complete (14%)**
