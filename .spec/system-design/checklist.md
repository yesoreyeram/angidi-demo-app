# System Design Concepts Checklist

This checklist tracks the implementation status of all system design concepts across the project phases.

**Last Updated**: $(date +"%Y-%m-%d")

## How to Use

- [ ] = Not yet covered
- [x] = Implemented and tested
- [~] = Partially implemented
- [!] = Skipped (with justification)

Update this checklist as you complete each phase and implement the corresponding concepts.
