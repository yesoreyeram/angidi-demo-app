# Project Phases

The Angidi project is structured in phases, with each phase introducing specific system design concepts, tools, and features. This incremental approach enables progressive learning of advanced system design principles.

## Phase Overview

| 1 | Basic Monolith Application | MVC pattern, REST APIs | Go, PostgreSQL, React | 2 weeks |
| 2 | First Microservice Decomposition | Microservices, service boundaries | Docker, Docker Compose | 2 weeks |
| 3 | Caching Layer | Caching strategies, performance | Redis | 1 week |
| 4 | Message Queue & Event-Driven | Async communication, events | Apache Kafka | 2 weeks |
| 5 | Search & Discovery | Full-text search, indexing | Elasticsearch | 2 weeks |
| 6 | Advanced Database Patterns | Sharding, replication, consistency | PostgreSQL replication | 2 weeks |
| 7 | Observability - Metrics & Logs | Monitoring, logging | Prometheus, Grafana, Loki | 2 weeks |
| 8 | Distributed Tracing | Request tracing, debugging | Jaeger/Zipkin | 1 week |
| 9 | Resilience Patterns | Circuit breakers, retries | Resilience libraries | 2 weeks |
| 10 | Security Hardening | Auth, encryption, compliance | OAuth, TLS, Vault | 2 weeks |
| 11 | Kubernetes Deployment | Container orchestration, scaling | Kubernetes, Helm | 3 weeks |
| 12 | Performance Optimization | Load testing, optimization | k6, profiling tools | 2 weeks |
| 13 | Chaos Engineering | Fault injection, resilience testing | Chaos Mesh, Litmus | 2 weeks |

**Total Estimated Duration**: ~28 weeks (7 months)

## Phase Structure

Each phase follows a consistent structure:

```

├── README.md                  # Phase overview and objectives
├── concepts.md                # System design concepts covered
├── design-decisions.md        # Rationale for technical choices
├── setup.md                   # Environment setup instructions
├── implementation-plan.md     # Detailed implementation steps
├── testing-strategy.md        # Test plans and BDD scenarios
├── documentation.md           # Documentation requirements
└── checklist.md              # Completion criteria
```

## Current Phase: Phase 0

We are currently in **Phase 0: Planning & Repository Setup**

### Objectives
- ✅ Create specification kit structure
- ✅ Define system design concepts
- ✅ Document functional requirements
- ✅ Document non-functional requirements
- ✅ Design high-level architecture
- ⏳ Create phase templates
- ⏳ Set up development environment guidelines
- ⏳ Define coding standards and conventions

## How to Navigate Phases

### Starting a New Phase
1. Review the phase README for objectives and goals
2. Study the concepts to understand what you'll learn
3. Read design decisions to understand the rationale
4. Follow setup instructions to prepare your environment
5. Implement following the implementation plan
6. Test according to the testing strategy
7. Complete documentation
8. Check off all items in the checklist

### Phase Completion Criteria
Each phase is considered complete when:
- [ ] All implementation tasks are finished
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, E2E)
- [ ] Code coverage meets threshold (>80%)
- [ ] Documentation is complete
- [ ] Security review passed (if applicable)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (if applicable)
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Checklist fully marked

### Phase Dependencies
Later phases build upon earlier ones. You must complete phases in order to ensure proper understanding and foundation.

## Getting Help

If you get stuck during any phase:
1. Review the phase documentation thoroughly
2. Check the design decisions for context
3. Consult the system design concepts document
4. Look at test examples for expected behavior
5. Review previous phases for foundational knowledge

## Contributing to Phases
