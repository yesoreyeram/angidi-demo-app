# Project Constitution

## Purpose

This document defines the fundamental principles, values, and constraints that govern the Angidi e-commerce platform project.

## Vision

Build a production-grade, highly scalable e-commerce platform that serves as a comprehensive learning resource for advanced system design concepts, demonstrating enterprise-grade architecture patterns, security practices, and operational excellence.

## Core Principles

### 1. Learning First

**Principle**: Education is the primary goal; the platform is a vehicle for learning.

**Application**:
- Each phase introduces concepts progressively
- Design decisions are thoroughly documented with rationale
- Trade-offs are explicitly discussed
- Real-world examples and references are provided

**Constraints**:
- Maximum 2 new tools/technologies per phase
- Complexity added incrementally, never all at once
- Every pattern must have clear learning objectives

### 2. Production Quality

**Principle**: Build as if deploying to production, not just for learning.

**Application**:
- Enterprise-grade security standards (PCI-DSS, GDPR)
- Comprehensive testing (>80% coverage)
- Full observability and monitoring
- Proper error handling and resilience patterns

**Constraints**:
- No shortcuts that wouldn't be acceptable in production
- Security reviews required for sensitive components
- Performance benchmarks must be met

### 3. Documentation as Code

**Principle**: Documentation is as important as code and maintained with the same rigor.

**Application**:
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for all significant decisions
- Comprehensive API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Detailed setup guides and troubleshooting
- BDD scenarios document expected behavior

**Constraints**:
- Code without documentation is incomplete
- Documentation must stay synchronized with code
- All decisions must be documented with rationale

### 4. Test-Driven Development

**Principle**: Tests define behavior; code implements tests.

**Application**:
- Write tests before implementation (TDD)
- Define behavior through scenarios (BDD)
- Unit, integration, and E2E tests required
- Performance and security testing included

**Constraints**:
- No code merged without tests
- Test coverage must exceed 80%
- All tests must pass before phase completion

### 5. Incremental Complexity

**Principle**: Start simple, add complexity only when needed.

**Application**:
- Phase 1 begins with a monolith
- Microservices introduced gradually (Phase 2+)
- Observability tools added in later phases (Phase 7-8)
- Each phase builds on previous phases

**Constraints**:
- No premature optimization
- No tool introduced before it's needed
- Clear justification required for complexity

## Technical Values

### Scalability
- Design for millions of users from day one
- Horizontal scaling preferred over vertical
- Stateless services enable easy scaling
- Database sharding planned from the start

### Reliability
- Target 99.99% uptime (5 minutes downtime/year)
- Fault tolerance and graceful degradation
- Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures
- Comprehensive backup and disaster recovery

### Security
- Defense in depth approach
- Encryption at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3)
- No secrets in code or version control
- Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning

### Observability
- Comprehensive logging (structured, centralized)
- Real-time metrics (Prometheus)
- Distributed tracing (Jaeger)
- Actionable alerting with clear runbooks

### Maintainability
- Clean, readable code following language conventions
- Consistent patterns across services
- Low coupling, high cohesion
- Refactoring encouraged and rewarded

## Architectural Constraints

### Service Design
- Microservices for independent scaling
- Database per service (no shared databases)
- API-first design with versioning
- Event-driven communication for async operations

### Technology Choices
- **Backend**: Go (primary), Node.js (select services)
- **Frontend**: React + Next.js + TypeScript
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch
- **Messaging**: Apache Kafka
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes

### Data Management
- Strong consistency for financial transactions
- Eventual consistency acceptable for catalog, search
- CQRS pattern for read/write separation
- Event sourcing for audit trails

## Development Standards

### Code Quality
- Follow language-specific style guides (gofmt, prettier)
- Static analysis must pass (golangci-lint, ESLint)
- Complexity metrics tracked (cyclomatic complexity <15)
- Regular code reviews required

### Git Workflow
- Feature branches from main
- Descriptive commit messages (conventional commits)
- Pull requests with comprehensive descriptions
- Minimum one approval before merge

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests: >80% coverage
- Integration tests: Critical paths covered
- E2E tests: Major user journeys
- Performance tests: Before production deployment

## Decision-Making Framework

### When to Create an ADR
- Significant architectural decisions
- Technology or tool selection
- Design pattern choices
- Trade-offs affecting multiple services

### ADR Requirements
- Clear problem statement
- Options considered with pros/cons
- Chosen solution with rationale
- Expected consequences and mitigations

### Escalation Path
1. Team discussion for implementation details
2. Tech lead for service-level decisions
3. Architect for cross-service impacts
4. Documented ADR for significant changes

## Project Governance

### Phase Progression
- Phases completed sequentially
- All acceptance criteria must be met
- Documentation complete before phase closure
- Retrospective conducted after each phase

### Quality Gates
- All tests passing (unit, integration, E2E)
- Code coverage meets threshold
- Security scan clean
- Performance benchmarks met
- Documentation updated

### Change Management
- Breaking changes require RFC (Request for Comments)
- Deprecation warnings for 2 phases before removal
- Migration guides for breaking changes
- Backward compatibility preferred

## Exceptions and Overrides

### When to Break Rules
Rules may be broken when:
- Learning objectives require it (documented)
- Security vulnerability demands immediate action
- Performance issue is critical
- External dependency forces change

### Override Process
1. Document the situation and constraint
2. Propose alternative approach
3. Get approval from tech lead
4. Document decision in ADR
5. Plan to address technical debt

## Review and Evolution

### Constitution Updates
- Reviewed at each phase boundary
- Updated based on lessons learned
- Changes require team consensus
- Version tracked in git

### Success Metrics
- Learning objectives achieved per phase
- Code quality metrics maintained
- System performance benchmarks met
- Team satisfaction with process

## Commitment

All contributors to the Angidi project commit to:
- Following these principles and constraints
- Maintaining documentation quality
- Prioritizing learning and understanding
- Building production-quality systems
- Supporting team members in their learning journey
